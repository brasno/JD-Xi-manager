# JD-Xi-manager
Managing Roland JD-Xi Interactive Analog/Digital Crossover Synthesizer on the Linux machine.

After many years, I am trying to pull more beautiful sounds from this small, but powerfull machine. I'll do it through USB MIDI interface.
Pakages into consideration are:
-  PySimpleGUI - https://www.pysimplegui.org/en/latest/
-  mido - https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
